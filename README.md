## Features

- **Voice chat** with Opus codec, noise cancellation (RNNoise), and echo cancellation
- **Screen sharing** with hardware-accelerated encoding (AV1/H.265/H.264)
- **End-to-end encryption** via QUIC (TLS 1.3)
- **Ed25519 identity** — no passwords, no email, just a seed phrase
- **SFU architecture** — server forwards, never decodes
- **Self-hosted** — run your own server on any machine

## Architecture

Single QUIC connection on UDP port 7800:

- **Control stream** (stream 0) — bidirectional, length-prefixed messages
- **Video stream** (stream 1) — reliable screen share frames
- **Voice datagrams** — unreliable, unordered Opus packets
